# rp_toolbox_proj
A personal django project I did on a dare. This is not intended to be a production-ready project or setup.

That said, if you want to have something to help track your local roleplay characters feel free to clone this repo and update it as you see fit.

##Requirements
* Python 3.x (I have 3.8, but this was deployed on 3.6 and it works fine)
* Django 3.0 or greater

You may note that there is a .ebextensions folder - this is for AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployments and is **not** required for the project to run.
